# Service Port Prefix

The `serviceportprefix` vetter inspects the port names defined in the services in
mesh and generates notes if they are missing Istio recognized port
protocol prefixes.

Service port names need to be prefixed with the recognized
[names](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/sidecar-injection/) for Istio
routing features to work correctly. If a port name doesn't begin with a
recognized prefix or is unnamed, traffic on the port is treated as plain TCP or
UDP depending on the port protocol.

Port names of the form `<protocol>-<suffix>` or `<protocol`> are allowed for
the following protocols as of Istio 1.1.0:

* http
* http2
* https
* grpc
* mongo
* redis
* tcp
* tls
* udp

Note that `tcp` protocol prefix can be used to indicate that the port
is for TCP protocol. Service ports with protocol type UDP are also excluded
from this prefix requirement.

It is recommended to add one of the above mentioned protocol prefixes to
the services mentioned in the generated notes.
